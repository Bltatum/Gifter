# Gifter

Short introduction or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)


## Learning Goals

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Requirements

This section is optional if there isn't any special dependencies. Else a bulletlist will suffice, e.g.,
+ Sql Server 
+ [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
